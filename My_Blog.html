<p class="sideborder"> The PyQt installer comes with a GUI builder tool called Qt Designer. Using its simple drag and drop interface, a GUI interface can be quickly built without having to write the code. It is however, not an IDE such as Visual Studio. Hence, Qt Designer does not have the facility to debug and build the application. Qt Designer lets you </p>

<p> Like buttons and save the interfaces as so called ui files, which are loaded during runtime of your program (or compilation). In Qt Designer you draw your windows and controls. The connection to your code is done by giving all objects meaningful names and declaring special commands in your source code. As mentioned earlier in the objective, this mini project has the its prime focus on the bookstore owners present.</p> 

<p>There is basically one language used in the scripting process, that is Python. The other two are MYSQL, which is the database used in the application while the graphical features were provided by Qt5Designer tool. There are certain big bookstores/book retailers who have a large amount of work to be done regarding books which includes restocking, selling, searching, billing etc. So, this mini project has been developed to decrease their burden by a great extent.</p>

<p class="sideborder"> If the customer further wants to buy another set of differently named books, he/she will click on the "Clear" button, which clear off all the boxes/information relating to the previous book. Now the customer can once again add the info of the new book and then click on the "Add another book" option. In this manner, the customer can. </p>

<p>I developed this mini project with no official help from anyone but only certain websites and google. I hadn't coded in python before and therefore learned the language from Internshala website with their summer training program of 2 months, which I completed in near about a month and scored 97% marks in the final test. The most important lesson I learned through this mini project was the benefits of debugging your own code. Yes, it took time to do that, but all the mistakes are clear in my mind and hence they won't be repeated. </p>
